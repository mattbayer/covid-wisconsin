To put it another way, I could note that the average vaccinated person is 1/3 as likely to die from Covid as an average unvaccinated person. But the average age of an average vaccinated person is XX years old, while the average of an unvaccinated person is YY years old.  If I'm making a decision about whether to get vaccinated, what I really want to know is how much it reduces the risk for me, a person with a definite certain age which is not going to change when I get the shot. That risk reduction is what the age-adjusted number is trying to estimate.


### Adjusting for natural immunity
Another confounding factor in these numbers is that some proportion of the not-fully-vaccinated bucket are partially vaccinated, and some have natural immunity from a previous infection. These individuals also have some level of risk reduction to the virus, and averaging them in with the fully non-immune gives that group a somewhat lower infection rate overall, and appears to reduce the vaccine effectiveness.

I can make a crude adjustment for this effect.
