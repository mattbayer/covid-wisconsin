Cases continue declining in Wisconsin. Deaths numbers are a bit erratic, but I expect them to decline overall in the future. I expect a temporary spurt of new cases from Christmas and New Year's, but as with Thanksgiving the data will be erratic for a while.

### Cases and deaths
Several weeks ago I predicted that [deaths had peaked](2020-12-7-status-update.md). The intervening weeks have proven this wrong. Here is an update of the graph 

Clearly the death curve has not followed the case curve, but instead stayed on an erratic plateau. I think this is due not to anything strange with the virus, however, but to increased delays in recording deaths.


I still think deaths should continue trending downward overall, but they perhaps won't follow the case curve as closely as I thought.

### A lump of covid in our stocking
Based on what happened with Thanksgiving, I would expect the Christmas holidays to also create a temporary spurt of new cases. I am somewhat more concerned than for Thanksgiving.
The Christmas season is just a longer period of time, including New Years. It is preceded by more shopping and activity, and in a normal year it involves probably two or three times more get-togethers than for Thanksgiving. Since Thanksgiving did not create a large increase in virus, and we are further from the peak, people may have been less cautious for Christmas. The Google mobility data, indeed, show a larger increase in activity prior to Christmas than it did prior to Thanksgiving.

On the other hand, I would not expect people's level of caution to change drastically, and it is true that we are at a lower level of virus activity overall. So my prediction would be that Christmas will cause a larger spurt of cases than Thanksgiving, in terms of percentage increase, but that the absolute case rate will not exceed the post-Thanksgiving mini-peak and the effect will still be temporary.

The case peak, measured by test date, occurred the second week in November. The peak in tests, interestingly, occurred the following week, while cases fell. Possibly this is because all the close contacts of the past week's positives were seeking testing; possibly it indicates that people were trying to get tested as a precaution before Thanksgiving week.
