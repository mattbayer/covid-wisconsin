title: Vaccines still work (continued)
hidden: true

DHS has begun releasing data on the rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in fully-vaccinated and not-fully-vaccinated people. This gives us the most direct look yet at how the vaccines are working in the real world, and against Delta.

### The top line numbers


### Adjusting for age
What does it mean when these numbers get adjusted for age? 

Let's take a simpler, more extreme situation. Imagine that our entire population was half kids under 12, who are entirely unvaccinated but still vanishingly unlikely to die; and half retirees over 65, who are 100% vaccinated but still have some likelihood (albeit much reduced) of dying from Covid. In this population 100% of Covid deaths would occur among the vaccinated, and 0% among the unvaccinated. But that would not be because the vaccines were ineffective - they could be very effective at reducing the chances of death for the over-65. It would be because the elderly were *both* more likely to be vaccinated, *and still* more likely to die of Covid. 

The real situation in our state, which mirrors the rest of the country, is not so extreme, but the same pattern is happening. The older someone is, the more likely they are to be vaccinated, and also the more likely they are to die if they catch Covid. So comparing deaths for the vaccinated and unvaccinated without accounting for age is misleading.

This effect, where the correlation between two quantities (here, vaccination and death) over the population as a whole can be very different from the correlation over subgroups of the population, is called [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).

Luckily the DHS is also now breaking out these numbers by age, and then compiling these age-stratified numbers into an "age-adjusted" number. This age-adjusted number is meant to convey the reduction in risk more accurately. 

To put it another way, I could note that the average vaccinated person is 1/3 as likely to die from Covid as an average unvaccinated person. But the average age of an average vaccinated person is XX years old, while the average of an unvaccinated person is YY years old.  If I'm making a decision about whether to get vaccinated, what I really want to know is how much it reduces the risk for me, a person with a definite certain age which is not going to change when I get the shot. That risk reduction is what the age-adjusted number is trying to estimate.


### Adjusting for natural immunity
Another confounding factor in these numbers is that some proportion of the not-fully-vaccinated bucket are partially vaccinated, and some have natural immunity from a previous infection. These individuals also have some level of risk reduction to the virus, and averaging them in with the fully non-immune gives that group a somewhat lower infection rate overall, and appears to reduce the vaccine effectiveness.

I can make a crude adjustment for this effect.





*They really really really really really really work*
