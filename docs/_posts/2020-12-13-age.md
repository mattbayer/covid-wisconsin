The bar graphs below show the age distribution of Wisconsin's population; Covid cases; Covid hospitalizations; and Covid deaths. These statistics are cumulative up until the present. They are similar to charts on the DHS's site, except that here I collect them together and compare them with population.[^Sources]

The distribution of population is quite flat, other than starting to taper off at age 70 as people pass away. Relative to shares of the population, Covid cases are a little higher in the middle aged, substantially higher for people in their 20's, and much lower for children under 10. This lower incidence among children could indicate that they are less susceptible to the virus, or it may only reflect the lower likelihood of diagnosing an infection as Covid in that age group.

Hospitalizations show a pronounced swing of the distribution toward the elderly - though still with plenty of middle-aged patients - and deaths shift to the old even further. In other words, the older a person is, the more likely their case will require hospitalization, and the more likely their hospitalization will end in death. 


A common gibe of Covid skeptics

It seems to me they can - but only in one isolated instance: college.

[^Sources]: To match up the age bins of the population and Covid data, I also had to combine the DHS's 80-89 and 90+ age ranges.
