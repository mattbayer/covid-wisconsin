The bar graphs below show the age distribution of Wisconsin's population; Covid cases; Covid hospitalizations; and Covid deaths. These statistics are cumulative up until the present. They are similar to charts on the DHS's site, except that here I collect them together and compare them with population.[^Sources]

The distribution of population is quite flat, other than starting to taper off at age 70 as people pass away. Relative to shares of the population, Covid cases are a little higher in the middle aged, substantially higher for people in their 20's, and much lower for children under 10. This lower incidence among children could indicate that they are less susceptible to the virus, or it may only reflect the lower likelihood of diagnosing an infection as Covid in that age group.

Hospitalizations show a pronounced swing of the distribution toward the elderly - though still with plenty of middle-aged patients - and deaths shift to the old even further. In other words, the older a person is, the more likely their case will require hospitalization, and the more likely their hospitalization will end in death.

So far, so unsurprising. 

In the table below, I computed the case fatality rate (CFR) for Wisconsin by simply dividing the number of deaths in each age category by the number of cases as of two weeks ago (since that's about the delay Wisconsin seems to have between its [reported case and death curves](2020-12-07-status-update.md)). I then compared it with an estimate of the infection fatality rate (IFR) from a recent paper that did a meta-analysis of a number of other studies.[^Paper] The IFR should be lower than the CFR - presumably we are not diagnosing and recording all Covid infections as cases, so the ratio of deaths to cases should be higher by some factor than the ratio of deaths to true infections.

Age group | Wisconsin CFR | Expected IFR
---------- | ----------- | -----------
0-9   | 0%    | 0.001%
10-19 | 0%    | 0.003%
20-29 | 0.02% | 0.01%
30-39 | 0.05% | 0.04%
40-49 | 0.14% | 0.12%
50-59 | 0.38% | 0.41%
60-69 | 1.3%  | 1.4%
70-79 | 4.8%  | 4.6%
80+   | 15%   | 15%
All   | 1.1%  | 1.1%

The first thing to note is that, as expected, the fatality rate increases exponentially with age. (And I mean exponential literally, not figuratively.) With each 10 years of age, the fatality rate goes up by a factor 3 to 4. 

The comparison with the IFR estimate is remarkable because it matches spookily well. In fact, it is actually too good a match, because if the observed CFR is exactly equal to the expected IFR, that would imply that Wisconsin is actually recording all of its Covid infections, which seems unlikely. If we are actually only recording, say, one-half or one-third of the true infections, that would imply that Wisconsin's total IFR is only one-half to one-third of its CFR (i.e. 0.55% or 0.37%).

I am not sure how to reconcile this. Some data sets from this meta-analysis did have lower IFRs, so Wisconsin's IFR probably does fall in its range of uncertainty. Wisconsin may somehow have more favorable demographics for the disease (other than age, which is accounted for), though I have no good guess for which demographic variable that may be. Since most of this paper's data came from earlier stages of the pandemic, it may also be possible that IFR has changed over time.  Perhaps now treatment has improved; or, more speculatively, methods for reducing spread have also lowered the average viral dose and decreased the likelihood of death.

In any case, though the overall IFR is uncertain, the strong dependence on age is well established. And it has become a common gibe of Covid skeptics that, given the low mortality risk to younger age groups, it is ridiculous for them to take measure to prevent catching the disease.

The risk of *catching* the disease does, indeed, seem quite low for younger people (though with the caveat that this does not capture non-fatal long-term effects). But the risk involved in *spreading* it is another matter.

DHS publishes a chart showing the rate of cases in different age groups over time. With one exception, the dynamics are very similar for all age groups. People over 65 are a little less likely to contract



It seems to me they can - but only in one isolated instance: college.

The 18-24 category is the one exception, but I believe it proves the rule. They had a big surge at the end of August as a result of [returning to college](2020-09-14-wisconsin-colleges.md), but this surge came under control and the cases in this age group then fell in line with everyone else. I tend to think this 18-24 outbreak was successfully contained - though this is arguable. But it seems to me that college students are among the most age-segregated populations 

If we can come up with ideas to further protect the elderly from Covid, by all means they should be implemented. But so far  

I take preventive measures not because I'm afraid of the virus (0.05% CFR for me) - but because I don't want to spread it to my parents (1.3%) or my grandparents (15%!).
