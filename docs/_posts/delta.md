title: The Delta delta

The new Delta variant has increased infections in Wisconsin. I think this surge will continue for a while, but at least the vaccines mean that its consequences will not be nearly as bad as previous ones.

### Delta is dominant
The Delta coronavirus variant, also known as B.1.617.2 - I think they're doing an experiment on us to see which naming system is more inscrutable - is now dominant in Wisconsin as well as the rest of the country.

Delta is supposed to be another step forward in infectousness compared to the last variant, Alpha / B.1.1.7, and even moreso compared to the previous strains. Infections are going up as a result, which we can see in both detected cases and the test positivity rate.

While the new Delta variant is probably the main reason for case increases, there could also certainly be contributions from seasonality (air conditioning weather) and the ongoing return to normal-ish behavior.

If we look around the state, we can see these increases are happening pretty broadly across the state. I don't see much of a regional pattern here, unlike last spring which concentrated in Milwaukee or [last fall](https://covid-wisconsin.com/2020/10/11/status-update/#the-northeast) which began in the northeast.

### Optimism / pessimism
If I had written a status update four weeks ago, the theme would have been "everything's great!" (Which is why it was easy to put off and not write.) I wouldn't say that anymore, but neither is everything terrible. For one thing, the numbers so far are still low compared to other phases of the pandemic. The rate of cases per day is not yet even as high as our last mini-wave in spring, and is less than 5% of the rate at the peak last fall.

A second reason to be optimistic is that the great majority of the most vulnerable people are vaccinated, including [over 80% of those over 65](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm). This will decrease the death rate going forward. Below is a plot comparing cases and deaths in Wisconsin over the course of the pandemic, scaled to roughly match up during the fall peak. The late spring mini-wave already saw a reduction in the ratio of deaths to cases, and I would expect that reduction to hold for this wave as well.

And while we do not have herd immunity (clearly), it is still likely that about two-thirds of the state has [some level of immunity]((https://covid-wisconsin.com/2021/06/14/immune/) from vaccination or previous infection, which ultimately limits the amount of damage that Delta can do. 

On the other hand, I don't see much hope of this wave turning around any time soon. During the spring mini-wave we had the cavalry coming: vaccinations were happening fast and summer was approaching. Now vaccinations are slow - though for the moment there are still more people getting vaccinated every day than getting infected - and fall is closer than I prefer to admit. My wild guess is that unless vaccinations significantly pick up (though they are picking up slightly), this wave will plateau a bit at the end of summer and then take off again in the fall.
