Infections are increasing again in Wisconsin, due to the new Delta variant. I think this surge will continue for a while, but at least the vaccines mean that its consequences will not be nearly as bad as previous ones.

### The Delta delta
The Delta coronavirus variant, also known as B.1.617.2 - I think they're doing an experiment on us to see which naming system is more inscrutable - is now dominant in Wisconsin as well as the rest of the country.

Delta is supposed to be another step forward in infectousness compared to the last variant, Alpha / B.1.1.7, and even moreso compared to the previous strains. Infections are going up as a result, which we can see in both detected cases and the test positivity rate.

If we look around the state, we can see these increases are happening pretty broadly across the state. I don't see much of a regional pattern here, unlike [last fall](https://covid-wisconsin.com/2020/10/11/status-update/#the-northeast).

While the new Delta variant is orobably the main reason for case increases, I think there could certainly be contributions from seasonality (the start of air conditioning season) and the ongoing return to normal-ish behavior.


If I had written a status update two weeks ago, the theme would have been "everything's great!"  And really that's still mostly true.

[Deaths-Cases plot]


The reasons to be optimistic are that it is still the case that the great majority of the most vulnerable people are vaccinated. And while we do not have herd immunity (clearly), it is still likely that about two-thirds of the state has some level of immunity from vaccination or previous infection, which limits the amount of damage that Delta can do. The numbers so far are still quite low compared to other phases of the pandemic.

I am getting more pessimistic they will go higher, however, almost certainly beyond the micro-surge we had in the spring. In the spring we had the cavalry coming: vaccinations were happening fast and summer was coming. Now vaccinations are slow - though there are still more people are getting vaccinated every day than are getting infected - and fall is closer than anyone here in Wisconsin would like to admit.
