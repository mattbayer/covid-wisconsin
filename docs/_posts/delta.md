If I had written a status update two weeks ago, the theme would have been "everything's great!"  That's still mostly true, but there is trouble in paradise.

The "Delta" variant is also known as "B.1.617.2".  (I think they're doing an A-B study to see which naming system is more inscrutable.) 


Infections are going up, which we can see in both detected cases and the test positivity rate.

If we look around the state, we can see these increases are happening pretty broadly across the state. I don't see much of a regional pattern here, unlike last fall.

I think it's safe to assume that the new Delta variant is the main reason.

The reasons to be optimistic are that it is still the case that the great majority of the most vulnerable people are vaccinated. And while we do not have herd immunity (clearly), it is still likely that about two-thirds of the state has some level of immunity from vaccination or previous infection, which limits the amount of damage that Delta can do. The numbers so far are still quite low compared to other phases of the pandemic.

I am getting more pessimistic they will go higher, however, almost certainly beyond the micro-surge we had in the spring. In the spring we had the cavalry coming: vaccinations were happening fast and summer was coming. Now vaccinations are slow - though there are still more people are getting vaccinated every day than are getting infected - and fall is closer than anyone here in Wisconsin would like to admit.
