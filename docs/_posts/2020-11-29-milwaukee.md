Milwaukee County contains about 1 million people. 

This bubble map has the same format as my [statewide maps](../dashboard-regional.md). The size of the bubble corresponds to the number of cases, hospitalizations, or tests inside a tract; while the color of the bubble corresponds to the value per thousand residents.

For someone who knows the geography of the city, the contours of these maps strongly echo the demographic boundary lines of the city. Below is another map; this one plots a dot for each resident, randomly distributed within census tracts, and colored according to race. It comes from a [project at the University of Virginia].^[FullMap]
