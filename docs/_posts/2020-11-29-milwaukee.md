Milwaukee County contains one million people, one-sixth of Wisconsin's total and enough to give it its own Covid geography.

The animation below maps out total cases, hospitalizations, and tests for each census tract in Milwaukee County. It has the same format as my [statewide maps](../dashboard-regional.md) - the size of the bubble corresponds to the absolute number inside a tract; while the color of the bubble corresponds to the value per thousand residents. For example, a larger bubble indicates a greater number of cases, while a darker bubble indicates that a larger percentage of the population has had a case.

For someone who knows the geography of the city, the contours of these maps strongly echo the demographic boundary lines of the city. Below is another map; this one plots a dot for each resident, randomly distributed within census tracts, and colored according to race. It comes from a [project at the University of Virginia](https://demographics.coopercenter.org/racial-dot-map/).[^FullMap] The exactness with which the Covid maps follow the boundaries of the racial map is striking.

Returning to the Covid maps, we can see that the highest concentrations of cases have occurred in the predominantly Hispanic near south side, and in an arc from Marquette University through downtown up the East Side to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Hospitalizations are also high in the Hispanic south side but relatively low in the downtown-East Side arc, I assume because of younger demographics in that area. In addition, however, hospitalizations are high throughout the majority-Black areas of the city, from the near north side to the far northwest. They are also relatively high in much of the majority-white parts of the south side. 

Some of the tracts with the highest hospitalization numbers, when examined closer, turn out to be the sites of long-term care facilities. The tract in the southeast bordering the lake, third from the bottom, [appears to have several](https://goo.gl/maps/DzxAdPz73xszn3om9), two of which I can find on the DHS's [list of facilities with Covid cases](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/investigations.htm).

More affluent predominantly-white areas such as Wauwatosa and the North Shore, in contrast, are relatively spared from hospitalizations. These same areas, though, along with the Marquette-to-UWM arc, have the highest rates of testing.

### Five stages
By looking at these same maps over time, I think I can identify 5 demographically distinct stages in the pandemic's run through Milwaukee.

1. Black Milwaukee was struck first and hardest in the spring. Recorded cases are low in this stage because of the lack of testing, but hospitalizations and deaths are high in the Black north side. 
1. Hispanic Milwaukee is hit next. Cases are very concentrated in the Hispanic near south side, although hospitalizations and deaths are more moderate.
1. Students and younger people in the Marquette-downtown-UWM arc contribute to a wave of cases in the late summer, but are not accompanied by many hospitalizations. Cases rise moderately in the rest of the city, along with hospitalizations. 
1. Early fall continues the pattern of the late summer, but with even more cases at Marquette and UWM campuses.
1. Late fall brings a surge across the whole city, with only the north shore and Wauwatosa relatively spared.

The map animation below illustrates cases and hospitalizations for each of these stages.
