Wisconsin's case load is now declining, and now I think deaths have also peaked. The Thanksgiving weekend is making the data difficult to intepret, but I do not think there's any sign of a Thanksgiving surge.

### Past the peak
Two weeks ago I [wrote that Wisconsin's cases had peaked](../2020-11-22-status-update.md), and thankfully that has been confirmed by about a 1/3 decline in daily new cases since then. New hospitalizations have also declined. The trend is roughly similar in all regions of the state, although Milwaukee's decline is flatter than the rest. 

I believe the rate of reported deaths may be at its peak right now, based on fitting a delay and ratio of deaths to cases (case fatality rate or CFR) to the case curve. Since it takes a few weeks for a new case to progress to death, we expect the death curve to have a similar shape to the case curve, just delayed. And over the short term of a single wave, it's reasonable to assume a constant case fatality rate. (Even though over the long term it could change, for example from diagnosing more cases due to more testing availability.)

I'm taking the idea for this comparison from [scientist Trevor Bedford](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1331780099490807808), who uses a CFR of 1.8% and delay of 22 days to model the United States as a whole. For Wisconsin, I found that a CFR of 1.0% and delay of 12 days seems to match the data better. This implies that Wisconsin is detecting a higher proportion of cases than the country as a whole, and that it has a shorter time period between reporting a case and reporting a death.

### Thanksgiving

You may object that the previous plot showed a huge dip in the deaths average right where I claim that it should be peaking. I think this dip is purely a result of delayed data reporting from the Thanksgiving holiday. As reporting catches up, I think the 7-day average will peak during the next week but then decline.

This holiday delay is a problem that appears in all the tracking data right now. As another example, consider the positivity rate, the percent of tests that come back positive for the virus.




This (predictable, understandable) problem will make it very difficult to tell if Thanksgiving itself has caused any kind of surge in the virus.
