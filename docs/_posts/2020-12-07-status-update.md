Wisconsin's case load is now declining, and now I think deaths have also peaked. The Thanksgiving weekend is making the data difficult to intepret, but I do not think there's any sign of a Thanksgiving surge.

### Past the peak
Two weeks ago I [wrote that Wisconsin's cases had peaked](../2020-11-22-status-update.md), and thankfully that has been confirmed by about a 1/3 decline in daily new cases since then. New hospitalizations have also declined. The trend is roughly similar in all regions of the state, although Milwaukee's decline is flatter than the rest. 

I believe the rate of deaths may be at its peak right now, based on fitting a delay and ratio of deaths to cases (case fatality rate or CFR) to the case curve.
