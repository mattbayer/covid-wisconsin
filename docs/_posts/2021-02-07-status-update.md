Cases and positivity rate continue their steady decrease, looking the very picture of exponential decrease. (Meaning that if infections decrease x% every week, the curve will start out steep and flatten over time as it approaches 0; the opposite of exponential growth that starts out flat but quickly accelerates.)

Some authorities warn that we're not testing enough, but I think that's unfounded. Testing numbers are going down, but I think at this point that's a natural part of the surge cycle. Once infections are decreasing, there are fewer people with symptoms and contacts who need to get tested, so demand for testing goes down as well. As long as the test positivity rate is also going down or at least remaining steady and low, it doesn't seem worrisome to me.

A side benefit of the lower testing demand is that it appears that response times have improved. I was tested several weeks ago and got the results by the end of the next day; the Milwukee County dashboard indicates that nearly 100% of tests are returned within 48 hours.

I think it behooves us to remain cautious and vigilant for now, but I am fundamentally still optimistic about beating the virus by the summer. 


### Vaccines
Vaccine distribution is going slower than we'd like to see, but I have been encouraged that in the last two weeks (since the 65+ group was given the green light), rates of vaccination have gone way up.

The proportion of people 65 and over who have received at least one dose is now XX%.
