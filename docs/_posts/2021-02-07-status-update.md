Cases and positivity rate continue their steady decrease, looking the very picture of exponential decrease. (Meaning that if infections decrease x% every week, the curve will start out steep and flatten over time as it approaches 0; the opposite of exponential growth that starts out flat but quickly accelerates.)

Some authorities warn that we're not testing enough, but I think that's unfounded. Testing numbers are going down, but I think at this point that's a natural part of the surge cycle. Once infections are decreasing, there are fewer people with symptoms and contacts who need to get tested, so demand for testing goes down as well. As long as the test positivity rate is also going down or at least remaining steady and low, it doesn't seem worrisome to me.

A side benefit of the lower testing demand is that it appears that response times have improved. I was tested several weeks ago and got the results by the end of the next day; the Milwukee County dashboard indicates that nearly 100% of tests are returned within 48 hours.

I think it behooves us to remain cautious and vigilant for now, but I am fundamentally still optimistic about beating the virus by the summer. 


### Vaccines
Vaccine distribution is going slower than we'd like to see, but I have been encouraged that in the last two weeks (since the 65+ group was given the green light), rates of vaccination have gone way up.

[DHS vaccination plot]

The proportion of people 65 and over who have received at least one dose is now XX%. Really that's pretty good progress, at this rate we would see 75% vaccination for 65+ by the end of the month.

What I do not like right now is that Milwaukee County has administered fewer doses than Dane County, despite having almost twice as many people! Here is a bar graph of all the regions in Wisconsin and their vaccinations per capita.

[Vaccinations per capita by region]

Madison (Dane County) is the best and Milwaukee County is the worst; other regions are in between. The fact that Madison ranks first makes me worry that Madison vaccinators may be getting more favorable vaccine allocations due to their closeness to the state machinery and perhaps better knowledge and communication with the distribution bureaucracy. But the fact that Milwaukee ranks last behind the other regions makes me worry that Milwaukee's governance and organization is at fault. 

Other possibilities are that it relates to the demographics of the regions; perhaps Madison has more health care workers, the first prioritized population, than other areas of the state. But I would have thought the same was true of Milwaukee. Perhaps more of the Milwaukee metro's health care workers and older people live in suburbs in the surrounding counties.
