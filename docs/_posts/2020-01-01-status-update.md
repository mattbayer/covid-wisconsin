### Everything going up
Two weeks ago [I sounded a couple optimistic notes](2020-10-11-status-update.md) - new cases had been hinting at flattening, and Milwaukee's wave had not yet gotten as bad as the late summer one - that have now been proven wrong. Wisconsin cases numbers paused, as if on a staircase landing, but then sprinted up the next flight. And Milwaukee's metrics are now the worst they have been since the pandemic first hit in March.

### College outbreaks are under control
Wisconsin kicked off the fall season with [large Covid outbreaks at colleges across the state](2020-09-14-wisconsin-colleges.md). But after many countermeasures, including locking down dorms for weeks, moving to virtual classes, and continuing widespread testing, things have ... [actually gotten under control?](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/cdc-director-uw-madison-covid-19-testing-outbreak-turnaround-model-for-nation/article_fc4c498b-9393-50bc-93c4-68aa15e597de.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=user-share) Here's cases at UW-Madison:

Here are cases at UW-Milwaukee:

And here's Marquette. This one's not trending down, but it's at least not exploding.

It seemed for a while that bringing students back was a huge mistake. But I think we have to give college administrators some credit - at least at some colleges - for at least attempting to adapt normal life to the pandemic, deploying testing and lockdowns effectively, and beating the pandemic back. At least for now.
