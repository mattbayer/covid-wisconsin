DHS has released their latest update on breakthrough cases, showing data for the month of September. The risk reduction from the vaccine appears to be pretty much the same as last month.

### September data by age group
Last month I wrote in detail on how to interpret these data, so for more background and August's numbers please see [that post](2021-09-23-vaccines-yes-still-work.md). Here I want to share plots of this month's data, and show how the age-adjusted risks are changing with time.

The bar plots below are a little complex, but I think helpful. Each compares vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for a different outcome: deaths, hospitalizations, and cases. The height of the bar indicates the rate of that outcome per 100,000 people. The width of each bar is proportional to the population of the group. 

This layout hopefully helps you visualize a common source of confusion. lets you visualize how deaths, for example, may be much more common in unvaccinated people over 65 (i.e. they have a higher rate and higher bar). But since the population of the vaccinated group in this age bracket is much larger, the absolute number of vaccinated deaths is about the same(?). Nevertheless, it is the *rate* of these outcomes that tells you the relevant risk reduction from being vaccinated.

Finally, the plots are divided up by age group, because the risk of death and hospitalization is so dependent on age.

Hospitalizations | 89% | YY%
Deaths  | 91%    | ZZ%
