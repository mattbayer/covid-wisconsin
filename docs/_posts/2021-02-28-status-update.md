### Vaccine progress
The [DHS vaccination dashboard](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm) is quite good, so I direct you there for looking at the data by week and by county. My takeaways are:
- Just over 50% of people over 65 have had at least one dose of the vaccine. This age group accounts for about three-quarters of Covid deaths in the state, so this is hugely important.
- About 200,000 doses have been administered each week for the past five weeks; that is great progress. While the state seemed to get off to a bit of a slow start, that is behind us and the major limitation on vaccinations right now is supply, not distribution.
- That said, supply is increasing. The weekly allocation of vaccines to Wisconsin, as reported on the dashboard, has increased from 140,000 per week earlier in the month to more than 200,000 per week now. Based on the schedule Moderna and Pfizer have committed to, these weekly numbers should continue to go up throughout March.
- Even so, for the time being first doses may be slowing down a bit. Now that we're several weeks into vaccinations, schedule second doses will be taking up a larger chunk of vaccines, slowing down the first doses for everyone else.

### Cases blip?
Over the last two weeks there has been a small spurt of cases at UW-Madison. I have been half-expecting this to happen again, repeating the fall's pattern of a large university wave after classes start. For now, though, it seems to have already subsided without much fanfare.

At the broader state level, the number of daily cases flattened and even blipped upwards for the first time in a while. I do not think this is cause for alarm at this point though. An unusually high number of negative tests was reported at the same time, so there may be some catch-up reporting going on. The statewide test positivity rate has also continued decreasing. If cases are flat but positivity is still going down, I think that is still a positive trend - though of course we'd like to see both continue going down.
