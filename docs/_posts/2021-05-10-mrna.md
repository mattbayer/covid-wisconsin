Despite the new technology involved, I have no worries about the mRNA vaccines. Here's why I like them.

First, a caveat. I am not a vaccinologist or anything close, so this is just the thinking of someone who reads too much Wikipedia. But hey, that's all of us this year, so maybe it's still useful. I welcome any corrections.

Actually my favorite source on vaccine development is not Wikipedia, but [Derek Lowe's blog](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/). He is a scientist who has worked on drug discovery for many years. His blog is exceptionally helpful, accessible, and frank. I'll be linking to several of his posts.

### What do they do?

The mRNA vaccines work by delivering mRNA molecules, along with some fats (i.e. "lipid nanoparticles"), into your cells. Recalling from high school biology, mRNA is short for messenger RNA, and its normal purpose is to transfer instructions for making proteins from the permanent DNA in the nucleus to a cell's ribosomes, where the mRNA is translated into the correct sequence of molecules to build a specific protein. In the vaccine's case, the mRNA codes for the coronavirus "spike" protein, which is the spiky bit in the virus cartoons that you see, and helps it enter our cells.

The spike protein then finds its way to the cell surface, where it triggers the immune response. The reason we inject vaccines into a muscle, I recently learned, is because that keeps all this activity localized to that muscle and nearby lymph nodes. The vaccine and spike protein don't go circulating through the whole body. The immune response, in contrast, and as we want it to, spreads to the whole body.

Now playing around with genetic material may sound a little dicey. There's even a claim that these are not proper "vaccines" at all, but more like gene therapies. But I do not think this is accurate. First, the mRNA in these vaccines is not DNA, does not enter the nucleus, and therefore cannot get incorporated into a cell's genome. It enters the cell, floats around until it gets taken up by a ribosome, and then gets translated into spike protein.

In fact, inserting RNA into our cells is also exactly what the coronavirus does. That's how viruses replicate - they insert their genetic material into our cells, where it gets translated into viral proteins.[^RNA virus] Unlike the vaccine, however, the virus itself codes for many different proteins, so that the cell will build new whole viruses. These accumulate until the cell bursts and releases them to infect other cells. 

So sure, all things equal, I would rather not have foreign RNA inserted into my cells. But I would rather have it be the RNA for exactly one protein, precisely selected to prime my immune system to avoid a disease, rather than the entire genome of a hostile infectious cell-killing uncontrollably replicating invader.

Inserting RNA or DNA into our cells is *also* exactly what many standard vaccines do. Many common vaccines, such as measles, rubella, one type of polio, and smallpox back in the day, are "attenuated virus" vaccines. This means they contain active virus that has been weakened or altered - bred in a certain sense, by letting it evolve in human cell lines in a lab - to not cause disease. It does still infect you, though, by inserting its genetic material into your cells and replicating. Because they mimic a real disease, these vaccines can provoke a strong, lasting immune response and are therefore very effective.

And while our attenuated-virus vaccines have shown to be very safe, the mRNA technology actually does have an intrinsic safety advantage over them. Attenuated vaccines are still active viruses; they have a remote risk of regaining virulence and causing disease after all. That can't happen with the mRNA vaccine.

The contrast between these types of vaccine also helps explain why development was so quick for the Covid vaccine. Part of the reason that vaccines usually take so long to develop is that the "breeding" of these attenuated viruses can take a long time, and is difficult to steer in the desired direction. 

For the mRNA vaccine, in contrast, the difficult part was knowing which protein to target. But we knew to target the spike from previous work on the original SARS. After that, it was only a matter of sequencing the virus gene for the spike, manufacturing the mRNA, and doing the testing.

The testing was actually the longest part of the process. It was sped up with lots of money, lots of volunteers, and lots of Covid circulating - not, as far as I know, by any reduction in rigor.

### HarmRNA?

Even though the clinical trials enrolled tens of thousands of people, that's still not enough to detect very rare, one-in-a-million side effects. (Of course, now 


Now it is certainly true that the Covid vaccines do not have have the advantage of long experience and long data collection. We can't know if there are any long-term effects, because there is no long term yet. 

But certainly that has to be even more true of Covid?

Which is more likely to have unknown long term effects? A dose of mRNA that makes your body produce some spike protein one day in your shoulder muscle? Or a virus that delivers the same mRNA, plus other genes, kills your cells, wildly replicates throughout your respiratory tract over the course of at least a week, and even kills a percentage of its hosts?

I think this is really the bottom line. The vaccine is clearly much, much better than getting Covid. Even though the mRNA vaccines employ new technology, I don't know of any reason to think that they would be less safe than other vaccines.

[^RNA virus]:The coronavirus is even what's called a positive-sense RNA virus, which means that its genetic material is RNA that gets directly taken up by our ribosomes, just like the mRNA in the vaccines. There are other viruses that contain DNA or "negative-sense RNA" that require intermediate steps inside the cell.


[Derek Lowe's post on getting vaccinated](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/04/07/getting-vaccinated). "For people who are honestly wondering about real immunological issues, though, I wanted to say that as someone whoâ€™s been doing drug discovery work for over 30 years now, and who has been covering the vaccine developments in detail with great interest during the entire pandemic, that I had no hesitation about rolling up my sleeve."



Some vaccines, such as "inactivated virus" vaccines, are dead viruses or pieces of viruses to present to the immune system. Examples of these include ...  The Novavax vaccine, which consists of already-assembled spike protein, uses this principle.
