The peak of the Omicron wave is now a couple weeks past.


Wisconsin reached its peak numbers of new infections about one week into January. This was not too clear at the time, because the unprecedented number of cases created a big backlog in state reporting. Then DHS flipped some switch on the 16th and cleared it (was that switch there the whole time?), creating the appearance of a huge surge. Now that the dust has cleared, though, we use DHS's data by test date 

As an example of how the reported data could be misleading, take a look at Milwaukee's cases by report date, and by test date.

By using genetic sequence data to divide up Wisconsin cases by variant, we see that Omicron has entirely taken over from Delta, and that it did so incredibly rapidly. Before Omicron showed up, I thought it was likely that Delta would peter out on its own, but no doubt Omicron's rapid sweep did accelerate that process. Some of the Omicron cases are probably "substitute" cases where people were infected by Omicron instead of Delta. But most of them are "extra" cases, many reinfections or breakthroughs, that would not have happened with Delta alone.

Even better news is that hospitalizations have also started to decline. despite the deluge of cases, hospit

It hasn't been long enough to really know how deaths are going to end up. We can see the beginning of an Omicron spike in the death data; more deaths will filter in the next couple weeks. I think it is safe to assume, however, that the fraction of cases that result in death will be far lower than the previous waves.
