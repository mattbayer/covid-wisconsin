### 

The number of cases being reported has shown a rise in this last week. So at first glance it seems easy to see that we are in the midst of a Christmas spurt. The report-date data is difficult to intepret, however, because its rise could also be due to testing and reporting being low or delayed during the holiday. So we need to drill down farther.

The reason this gets so complicated is that there are three steps between a test being taken and the public knowing about it. There's 1) test performed; 2) results returned; and 3) results reported by DHS. Data by test date (1) is the most informative, but the least publicly available and is always incomplete for recent days. Result date (2) is more available but also always incomplete, while report date (3) is the most easily available and most complete, but is the most difficult to interpret due to varying reporting delays.

The next level to look at is result date, which I will plot along with positivity.
