The spring wave appears to have ended, thankfully long before it got bad at all. In terms of cases, it turned out smaller even than the late summer wave from last year. Since it was so small overall, and because it hardly touched the largely vaccinated over-65 age group, I would predict that any effect on deaths would be small enough that it would not even be visible in the data.

It is interesting that all four midwestern states with spring waves peaked the same week, even though our severities were much different. The synchronicity makes me think that the crest of the wave must be due to some combination of vaccination and seasonality, since both vaccination pace and obviously climate are quite similar among theses states.
