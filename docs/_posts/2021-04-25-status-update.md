### The spring wave

The spring wave has clearly crested, thankfully long before it got bad at all. Both reported cases and test positivity rate are now declining.

In terms of cases, this spring wave (in Wisconsin) turned out even smaller than the late summer wave from last year. It also hardly touched the largely vaccinated over-65 age group, so I would expect a relatively small number of deaths as a result - possibly not even detectable as a wave in the death data.

Interestingly, all [four midwestern states](2021-04-11-variants-midwest.md) with spring waves peaked this same week, including hard-hit Michigan, even though the severity was much different in each state. The synchronicity makes me think that the crest of the wave must be due to some combination of vaccination and seasonality, since both vaccination pace and climate are quite similar among theses states.

### Vaccinations
Wisconsin has now vaccinated more than 50% of adults and more than 40% of the entire population. The number of doses being administered per week has started to decline, however, which has two causes. The first is the pause in administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine; the week of April 4 had XX J&J vaccines, while the following week had XX; that is almost enough to account for the entire difference.

The second cause is that vaccine demand is probably slackening. If true this dismays me - we're only at 40% of the population! - but it's also probably shouldn't be surprising. More than half of everyone eligible has received at least one dose; it's only natural that the fewer people remain, the lower demand will be.
