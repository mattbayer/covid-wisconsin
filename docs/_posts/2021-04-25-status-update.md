### Wisconsin spring

The spring wave has clearly crested, thankfully long before it got bad at all. Both reported cases and test positivity rate are now declining.

In terms of cases, this spring wave (in Wisconsin) turned out even smaller than the late summer wave from last year. It also hardly touched the largely vaccinated over-65 age group, so I would expect a relatively small number of deaths as a result - possibly not even detectable as a wave in the death data.

Interestingly, all [four midwestern states](2021-04-11-variants-midwest.md) with spring waves peaked this same week, including hard-hit Michigan, even though the severity was much different in each state. The synchronicity makes me think that the crest of the wave must be due to some combination of vaccination and seasonality, since both vaccination pace and climate are quite similar among theses states.

Unfortunately, Milwaukee appears to be an unfortunate exception here. While cases in Wisconsin as a whole have tipped downwards, in Milwaukee they are steady or even slowly rising.

A big part of the reason, I think, is the failure to get more vaccines to the central city.  Below are two maps, the first showing percentage of people vaccinated, and the right showing new Covid cases in the last 30 days. The largely Black north side, not coincidentally, has both the lowest vaccination rates and the highest recent Covid rates.

### Vaccinations

Wisconsin has now vaccinated more than 50% of adults and more than 40% of the entire population. The number of doses being administered per week has started to decline, however, which has two causes. The first is the pause in administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine; the week of April 4 had XX J&J vaccines, while the following week had XX; that is almost enough to account for the entire difference.

The second cause is that vaccine demand is probably slackening. If true this dismays me - we're only at 40% of the population! - but it's also probably shouldn't be surprising. More than half of everyone eligible has received at least one dose; it's only natural that the fewer people remain, the lower demand will be.
