In Wisconsin people over 65 were vaccinated before other age groups, and [a month ago](2021-03-21-vaccines-work.md) I argued that their Covid cases were decreasing faster than everyone else. It took some analysis, though, because when everything is going down it's hard to see when one line is going down somewhat faster than the rest.

Now that we have had a spurt of new cases, however, that problem is solved, and you can just eyeball the graph. From DHS:

The case rate for people over 65 is pulling away from the pack; while everyone else's rates have moderately increased over the last few weeks, the case rate for those over 65 has stayed flat. Let's zoom in.

A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that this is *about* the level of reduction in cases I would expect from the level of vaccination for over-65s. Compare the over-65 category to under-18. People under 18 have hardly been vaccinated at all, so their case trajectory should show no effect of vaccination. 

In the week of January 10, the over-65 and under-18 categories had case rates of 181 and 146 (per 100,000 people), respectively. On April 25% higher case rate than under-18. In the week of April 4, their rates were 34 and 75. In the absence of the vaccines, let's assume the ratio of these rates would have remained the same. In that case, by the week of April 4 the case rate for the over-65 would have been 181/146\*75 = 93. 

Since the actual rate was only 34, by this reasoning the vaccines prevented 63% of that week's over-65 Covid cases. That's pretty close to the percentage of people over 65 who have received two doses, which is 71% as of this writing and would have been a few points lower during the week of April 4.

For the record, the plot of age group's case rates normalized to the average that I used in my last vaccines post now looks like this:

The relative rate for the over-65 has bottomed out in recent weeks, which makes sense because their rate of vaccination slowed down as it entered the 70-80% range. There is also maybe a slight downward trend for the 55-64 group, which happens to have the second highest [vaccination rate](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm) behind the over-65 group (53% one dose, 28% two doses).
