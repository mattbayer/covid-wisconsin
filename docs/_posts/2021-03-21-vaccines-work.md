Wisconsin's Covid cases peaked way back in November, due to (I believe) a combination of natural immunity and preventive behavior. Since cases have already been declining for quite a while, is there any way to tell if the vaccines are having an effect? By comparing cases and hospitalizations among those 65 and over with the rest of the population, we can show that vaccination is working.

### 
In Wisconsin, vaccine eligibility was opened to anyone 65 and over starting on January 25. Before that, elibility was limited to healthcare workers and people in long-term care. At the time of writing, [over two-thirds of seniors have received at least one dose](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm), compared with less than 20% for other age groups. Therefore, between January 25 and today, I would expect to see the Covid rates among seniors decrease faster than the rates among other age groups.

The best data to look at this is DHS's plot of weekly cases, by age group, by date of symptom onset or test result. (The more common plot of cases shows them by date of report, which is less reliable.) Here is the full plot copied from the DHS website:

Currently, the over-65 age group does indeed have the lowest case rate - but this was true all during the fall surge as well, so that alone doesn't show much. I assume their lower case rate is because of typically lower numbers of social contacts - likely retired, not going to parties - and perhaps higher personal precautions. 

In contrast, the under-18 rate, while still decreasing, appears to have decreased less quickly than all other age groups. I would speculate this is due to a lower level of natural immunity - since their case rates have been much lower all through the pandemic - and perhaps because many schools went more virtual during the fall surge but returned to in-person later.

To look more closely, I downloaded this data and normalized each age group's rate to 100% as of January 25. This way we can see how much each age group's case rate has declined since over-65 eligibility opened.

This plot shows that cases in the over-65 group have in fact decreased faster than other age groups. Moreover, it looks like this divergence started after the week of February 7, two weeks after eligibility. The vaccine clinical trials indicate that their effectiveness begins [two weeks after the first dose].

Another data point to look at would be hospitalizations by age. They are a more important outcome than cases in themselves. And we know that the vaccines are probably even more effective at preventing hospitalization and death than they are at preventing transmission. 

Unfortunately, the only death-by-age data that is publicly available is deaths by date of report, which has recently been particularly unreliable. When you add up the two weeks for the vaccines to begin working, the three or more weeks to proceed from infection to death, and then the unknown number of weeks for a death to be recorded, it seems unlikely that death data will show anything useful yet.
