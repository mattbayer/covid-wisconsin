Wisconsin's Covid cases peaked way back in November, due to (I believe) a combination of natural immunity and preventive behavior. Since cases have already been declining for quite a while, is there any way to tell if the vaccines are having an effect? By comparing cases and hospitalizations among those 65 and over with the rest of the population, we can show that vaccination is working.

### 
In Wisconsin, vaccine eligibility was opened to anyone 65 and over starting on January 25. Before that, elibility was limited to healthcare workers and people in long-term care. At the time of writing, [over two-thirds of seniors have received at least one dose](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-data.htm), compared with less than 20% for other age groups. Therefore, between January 25 and today, I would expect to see the Covid rates among seniors decrease faster than the rates among other age groups.
