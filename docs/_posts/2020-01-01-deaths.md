title: Draft - Deaths

Covid has killed [about 220,000 people in the United States](https://covidtracking.com/). If you measure by "excess deaths," meaning deaths that have occurred this year in excess of what would have been statistically expected, it is [over](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1322253419491561473?s=20) [300,000](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm). But let's stick with the more regularly cited 220,000 number for now.

On the one hand, that's [as many Americans as died in the Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war); it's [67 9/11's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks). On the other hand, it's only [a third of the number of people who die of heart disease every single year](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm); it's [0.06% of the US population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States). 

This is a table of deaths in Wisconsin in 2017, the most recent year there is a complete [death report from the DHS](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p01170-19.pdf).

Ranking | Cause of death | Deaths 
--| ---------- | ----------- 
...| Total | 52,679
1 | Heart Disease | 11,815
2 | Cancer | 11,287
3 | Unintentional Injury | 3,707
4 | Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease<br>(e.g. asthma, emphysema) | 2,830
5 | Stroke | 2,509
6 | Alzheimer's | 2419
7 | Diabetes | 1,428
8 | Flu / Pneumonia | 970
9 | Kidney Disease | 922
10 | Suicide | 915
...| Drug overdose<br>(unintentional and suicide) | 1,171
...| Homicide | 203

Just looking at this table is enough to rebut two of the common arguments that Covid is no big deal. First, Covid is clearly worse than the flu - it has already killed twice as many people as flu and pneumonia did in 2017, and that's before we have even gone through a winter with it.

Second, it seems extremely unlikely that suicides brought on by the social isolation of lockdown will outnumber Covid deaths. This may well be a serious problem; I have not looked into the data enough to know how serious. But suicides would have to double compared to 2017 in order to equal the Covid deaths so far. My intuition is that as difficult as this year has been, it's not plausible it will have that large an effect on suicides.

A third argument, that Covid may be serious but that it's not out of line with other risks we routinely tolerate, has more force. Unintentional injury, for example, was responsible for nearly 4000 deaths in 2017, twice as many as Covid so far. Many of these accidents, like Covid, could probably be prevented through draconian lockdowns. If we are okay with 4000 accidental deaths a year, should we accept up to 4000 Covid deaths this year?

Maybe so. Most likely we will have to in any event. I do not think winter will end before we have seen 4000 deaths in this state. Very crudely: extrapolate the current average deaths per day to the end of the year. 30 deaths/day times 60 days equals 1800 deaths; add to the current 2000 and there's a rough 4000.

The case for restrictions and Covid prevention does not ultimately rest, however, on the number of deaths we have had so far, but on the number of deaths we may be able to prevent. We cannot know this with much certainty, but we can estimate.

Assume a population-wide infection fatality rate (percentage of infections that end in death) of 0.5%, and that only 50% of the population needs to be infected before widespread acquired immunity suppresses the virus. These are both middle-of-the-range values. With Wisconsin's population of 5.8 million, that would result in about 15,000 total deaths.

These values are not known with much precision, but they are known within an order of magnitude. IFR might be 0.3% or 1%; the "herd immunity" threshold might be 30% or 80%. Using these numbers, a low estimate of expected deaths would be 5,000, and a high estimate 46,000.
