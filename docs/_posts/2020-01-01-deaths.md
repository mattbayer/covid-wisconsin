Covid has killed [more than 200,000 people in the United States](https://covidtracking.com/). If you measure by "excess deaths," meaning deaths that have occurred this year in excess of what would have been statistically expected, it is probably [over 300,000](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm). But let's stick with the more regularly cited 200,000 number for now.

On the one hand, that's [as many Americans as died in the Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war); it's [67 9/11's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks). On the other hand, it's only [a third of the number of people who die of heart disease every single year](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm); it's [0.06% of the US population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States).
