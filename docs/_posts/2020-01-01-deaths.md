title: Draft - Deaths

Covid has killed [about 220,000 people in the United States](https://covidtracking.com/). If you measure by "excess deaths," meaning deaths that have occurred this year in excess of what would have been statistically expected, it is [over](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1322253419491561473?s=20) [300,000](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm). But let's stick with the more regularly cited 220,000 number for now.

On the one hand, that's [as many Americans as died in the Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war); it's [67 9/11's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks). On the other hand, it's only [a third of the number of people who die of heart disease every single year](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm); it's [0.06% of the US population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States). 

This is a table of deaths in Wisconsin in 2017, the most recent year there is a complete [death report from the DHS](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p01170-19.pdf).

Ranking | Cause of death | Deaths 
--| ---------- | ----------- 
...| Total | 52,679
1 | Heart Disease | 11,815
2 | Cancer | 11,287
3 | Unintentional Injury | 3,707
4 | Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease<br>(e.g. asthma, emphysema) | 2,830
5 | Stroke | 2,509
6 | Alzheimer's | 2419
7 | Diabetes | 1,428
8 | Flu / Pneumonia | 970
9 | Kidney Disease | 922
10 | Suicide | 915
...| Drug overdose<br>(unintentional and suicide) | 1,171
...| Homicide | 203


Clearly Covid is worse than just the flu - it has already killed twice as many people as flu and pneumonia together did in 2017. Accidents is another interesting comparison, because accidents, like Covid, could probably be prevented through draconian lockdowns. If we are okay with 4000 accidental deaths a year,should we accept up to 4000 Covid deaths this year?
