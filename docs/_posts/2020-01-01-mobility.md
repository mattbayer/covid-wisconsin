Last Tuesday Governor Evers issued an executive order exhorting, but not requiring, Wisconsin residents to stay home as much as possible. I think there is widespread skepticism that the government can actually do anything to slow the spread of the virus.

Since Covid started, Google and Apple have been publishing data extracted from phones on people's mobility. [Google's data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) is based on changes in time spent at various categories of place, such as retail/recreation, workplace, and residential. [Apple's data](https://covid19.apple.com/mobility) is based on requests for directions, and turns out to not be as interesting, so for this post I will concentrate on Google.
