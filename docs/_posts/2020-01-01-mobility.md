Last Tuesday Governor Evers issued an executive order exhorting, but not requiring, Wisconsin residents to stay home as much as possible. I think there is widespread skepticism that the government can actually do anything to slow the spread of the virus.

Since Covid started, Google and Apple have been publishing data extracted from phones on people's mobility. [Google's data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) is based on changes in time spent at various categories of place, such as retail/recreation, workplace, and residential. [Apple's data](https://covid19.apple.com/mobility) is based on requests for directions, and turns out to not be as interesting, so for this post I will concentrate on Google.

### Wisconsin as a whole
Here is a plot of Google's mobility measure for the state of Wisconsin. This is really interesting. [Google explains](https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9824897?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927) that each day is compared to a baseline for that day of the week, measured over five weeks in January. 

1. **The spring lockdown** caused a huge decrease in activity in the workplace, transit, and recreation categories that gradually recovered to a new normal level that was still substantially lower than baseline. I am using "lockdown" as a shorthand, much of this decrease is certainly due to voluntary individual action rather than directly the result of government restrictions.

1. **Grocery/pharmacy** decreased less - obviously these trips are more essential - and nearly recovered to baseline during the summer. I think you can even see a little bump there before lockdown hit, showing people stocking up. 

1. **Working from home** creates a pronounced weekday-weekend pattern, with the workplace category showing large decreases on weekdays. It shows less of a change on weekends, I assume because people who work on weekends (retail, nurses, factory shift work) are less likely to be able to work from home. Weekend work did decrease substantially during the spring lockdown, but in the summer nearly recovered to the baseline. Weekday work, in contrast, retained most of its decrease. Residential is just the mirror image of the workplace pattern - if you're not at work, you're probably at home.

1. **Holidays** show up as sharp little spikes. You can definitely see Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day and maybe Easter if you squint.

1. **Parks** in Wisconsin are way more popular in July than in January, what a surprise! They also vary a lot day to day, which I could guess is due to weather. It would be interesting to know if people are using parks less (because of Covid) or more (because it's the only safe-ish thing to do), but I don't think this data can tell us that without a prior year to compare with.

1. **The Safer-at-Home order** was struck down on May 13. This data actually does not show a strong change in people's behavior at that date. I think that lends support to the idea that popular opinion and social behavior are actually more important than the letter of government policies. On the other hand, it could also mean that the local restrictions in place by that time in places like Madison and Milwaukee were strong enough that the state restrictions were not significant.

### Compare across regions
This data gets specific even to the county level, so I can compare across regions of the state. The plots below compare Milwaukee, Dane (Madison), and Brown (Green Bay) counties, focusing on the workplace and retail/recreation categories.
