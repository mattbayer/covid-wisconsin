title: I like the mRNA vaccines
hidden: true

There's some understandable hesitation about the new technology behind the mRNA vaccines. Here's what I've learned and why I like them.

### Wikipedia ahead

I am not a biologist, so this is just the result of my amateur research. I welcome correction.

His blog is exceptionally helpful, accessible, and frank. I'll be linking to several of his posts.

The mRNA vaccines work by delivering mRNA molecules, along with some fats, into your cells. Recalling from high school biology, mRNA is short for messenger RNA, and its normal purpose is to transfer instructions for making proteins from the permanent DNA in the nucleus to a cell's ribosomes, where the mRNA is translated into the correct sequence of molecules to build a specific protein. In the vaccine's case, the mRNA codes for the coronavirus "spike" protein, which is the spiky bit in the virus cartoons that you see, and helps it enter our cells.

### mmm, RNA?

Now playing around with genetic material may sound a little dicey. I have seen an argument that these are not actually vaccines at all, but more like gene therapies. But I do not think this is accurate. First, the mRNA in these vaccines is not DNA, does not enter the nucleus, and therefore cannot get incorporated into a cell's genome. It enters the cell, floats around until it gets taken up by a ribosome, and then gets translated into spike protein.

In fact, inserting RNA into our cells *is also exactly what the coronavirus does*. This is how viruses replicate - they insert their genetic material into our cells, where it gets translated into viral proteins. The coronavirus is even what's called a positive-sense RNA virus, which means that its genetic material is RNA that gets directly taken up by our ribosomes, just like the mRNA in the vaccines. There are other viruses that contain DNA or "negative-sense RNA" that require intermediate steps inside the cell.

Unlike the vaccine, however, the virus itself induces production of many different proteins, so that the cell will build new whole viruses. These accumulate until the cell bursts and releases them, whence they proceed to infect other cells. 

So sure, all things equal, I would rather not have foreign RNA inserted into my cells. But I would rather have it be the RNA for exactly one protein, precisely selected to prime my immune system to avoid a disease, rather than the entire genome of a hostile infectious cell-killing uncontrollably replicating invader.

And I'll belabor this point further. Inserting RNA or DNA into our cells *is also exactly what many standard vaccines do*. Many common vaccines, such as measles, rubella, some varieties of polio, smallpox back in the day, are "attenuated virus" vaccines. This means they contain active virus that has been weakened or altered - bred in a certain sense, by letting it evolve in human cell lines in a lab - to not cause disease. It does still infect you, though, by entering your cells and replicating. Because they mimic a real disease, these vaccines often provoke a stronger, more lasting immune response and are therefore more effective.

While I believe these attenuated-virus vaccines have also proven to be very safe, the mRNA technology actually has an intrinsic safety advantage over them. Attenuated vaccines are still active viruses; they have the remote risk of regaining virulence and causing disease after all. That is not a possibilty with the mRNA vaccine. And both types insert genetic material into your cells; but the mRNA vaccine is still more limited and targeted.

### Was it too fast?

The contrast between these types of vaccine also helps explain why development was so quick for the Covid vaccine. Part of the reason that vaccines usually take so long to develop is that the "breeding" of these attenuated viruses can take a long time, and is difficult to steer in the desired direction. For the mRNA vaccine, in contrast, the difficult part was knowing which protein to target - but we knew to target the spike from previous work on the original SARS. After that, it was only a matter of sequencing the virus gene for the spike, manufacturing the mRNA, and doing the testing. 

(And the testing was made quicker with lots of money, lots of volunteers, and lots of Covid circulating.)

### What do we know about safety?



Now it is certainly true that the Covid vaccines do not have have the advantage of long experience and long data collection. We can't know if there are any long-term effects, because there is no long term yet. 

But certainly that has to be even more true of Covid?

Which is more likely to have unknown long term effects? A dose of mRNA that makes your body produce some spike protein one day in your shoulder muscle? Or a virus that delivers the same mRNA, plus other genes, kills your cells, wildly replicates throughout your respiratory tract over the course of at least a week, and even kills a percentage of its hosts?

[Blog post by Derek Lowe on types of vaccines](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects). He is a scientist who has worked on drug discovery for many years; his blog has been my best source on vaccine development.

[Derek Lowe's post on getting vaccinated](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/04/07/getting-vaccinated). "For people who are honestly wondering about real immunological issues, though, I wanted to say that as someone whoâ€™s been doing drug discovery work for over 30 years now, and who has been covering the vaccine developments in detail with great interest during the entire pandemic, that I had no hesitation about rolling up my sleeve."



Some vaccines, such as "inactivated virus" vaccines, are dead viruses or pieces of viruses to present to the immune system. Examples of these include ...  The Novavax vaccine, which consists of already-assembled spike protein, uses this principle.
