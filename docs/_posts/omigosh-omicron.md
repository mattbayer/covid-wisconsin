First of all, I need to stop making predictions, because Covid seems to take that as an invitation to sweep the world with a new variant. [Last June](https://covid-wisconsin.com/2021/06/14/immune/#is-it-enough) I predicted a quiet summer and smallish winter wave; by July Delta had taken over the state, sparked a late-summer wave, and worsened the winter prognosis. Then in [early November](2021-11-11-covid-winter-2.md) I predicted that Wisconsin would see a sizable winter wave of Delta, but that this would be the last major Covid waves. Two weeks later Omicron was discovered. 

We're still having a winter wave, of course, but its complexion is quite a bit different. It might still be "the end", but I'm going to refrain from throwing a parade yet.

### Omicron in Wisconsin
As of this writing, it looks like Omicron makes up over 50% of cases in Wisconsin, and will likely be more than 90% within another week or two. It was less than 5% at the beginning of December. The warnings about how fast it would take over and spread turned out to be true.

I think we are just starting to see this translate into a spike of new cases. Below is a plot of positive tests multiplied by the variant fractions above. So far, Omicron has not created a big spike of new cases here, as it has in many other places already. 


First, Omicron substantially reduces the effectiveness of previous infection and vaccination against new infection. This makes breakthrough and reinfection more likely, increasing the pool of susceptible people and increasing transmission. It also seems likely to have a shorter transmission interval - the time between infection and onward transmission - which means it both spreads and peaks faster. Together, these two traits explain why Omicron is spreading so quickly
1. Omicron may or may not be intrinsically more transmissible than Delta, "intrinsically" meaning in people without some form of immunity. It is hard to disentangle intrinsic and immunity effects.
1. Immunity from previous infection and from vaccination holds up much better against severe disease. If you are vaccinated or previous had Covid, you are more likely to get it or get it again than previously, but your immunity will still help you have a milder case.
1. Omicron seems likely to be intrinsically less severe than Delta. Again it is difficult to disentangle intrinsic and immunity effects
