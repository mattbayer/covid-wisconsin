First of all, I need to stop making predictions, because Covid seems to take that as an invitation to sweep the world with a new variant. [Last June](https://covid-wisconsin.com/2021/06/14/immune/#is-it-enough) I predicted a quiet summer and smallish winter wave; by July Delta had taken over the state, sparked a late-summer wave, and worsened the winter prognosis. Then in [early November](2021-11-11-covid-winter-2.md) I predicted that Wisconsin would see a sizable winter wave of Delta, but that this would be the last major Covid waves. Two weeks later Omicron was discovered. 

We're still having a winter wave, of course, but its complexion is quite a bit different. It might still be "the end", but I'm going to refrain from throwing a parade yet.
