### The easy way
Here's one way to get an estimate of the true number of new infections per day.

1. Take the 7-day average of new cases.
1. Multiply by 2.

That's it! 

### The medium way
This is a formula I came up with, so take it with a grain of salt. But I really think it strikes a balance of simplicity and plausibility that I have not seen anywhere else.

Testing some math: $$E=mc^2$$.

Testing some more math: \( E = mc^2 \)

$$ E = mc^2 $$

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]


Goodbye!
