Cases continue declining in Wisconsin. Deaths numbers are a bit erratic, but I expect them to decline overall in the future. Thanksgiving was not able to reverse this trajectory, although I think the data shows it did lead to a modest increase in infections.

### Status update: deaths and cases
Two weeks ago I predicted that [deaths had peaked](2020-12-7-status-update.md). The intervening weeks first seemed to confirm this prediction, but in the last few days the average has swung upward again. It looks like this upswing may be driven by some batch reporting from especially Madison and Milwaukee, which you can see in the [regional plots](../dashboard-regional.md). I still think deaths should continue trending downward overall, but they perhaps won't follow the case curve as closely as I thought.

The case peak, measured by test date, occurred the second week in November. The peak in tests, interestingly, occurred the following week, while cases fell. Possibly this is because all the close contacts of the past week's positives were seeking testing; possibly it indicates that people were trying to get tested as a precaution before Thanksgiving week.
