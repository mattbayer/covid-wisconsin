...of the Jordan Love era? (Just kidding (maybe).) Actually, of a winter surge. Wisconsin has been 
Still, I have been waiting for signs of a winter surge, and I think the data from the last week show that it might be starting. If we do, I expect fewer cases than last winter, far fewer deaths, and that this will finally be the last major wave.

### Where we're at

In the last two months Wisconsin has seen a consistent, moderate level of new cases. The rise after summer was instigated by the more transmissible Delta variant becoming dominant. The Delta wave was very high in the South, comparable or worse for them than last winter's wave. But here cases plateaued and have just been plugging along. 

[Cases and positivity rate]

There was a further boost in September that I think is primarily due to schools. If you break out cases by age, school-age kids and those 30-50 (their parents) account for most of the extra bump in September. Then that bump dies away, imitating an overall decrease in cases when in reality, cases in all the other age groups were pretty constant.

[Cases and ages]

This mirrors a pattern from last year, where the start of the college year resulted in a large spike of cases, which then settled down and basically followed the trajectory of the rest of the state. This seems to suggest that large *changes* in people's contacts and socializing can result in case spikes, which then can subside after an adjustment period.

### Deaths

The first bit of good news is that the fatality rate has been lower for this wave, which I think is directly due to the vaccine. The most vulnerable ages have high vaccination rates, whcih means the pool of unprotected people is less at risk of death, on average. 

[Cases and deaths]

You might question why deaths are even this high - the vaccine is supposed to be 90% or more effective at preventing death, why is the death rate only 50% lower than last winter? Well, the majority of people getting sick are not vaccinated. So the reduction of the death rate is not predominantly from vaccinated people getting sick and not dying, but because the people who do get sick (majority unvaccinated), are less old on average than they were last winter.
