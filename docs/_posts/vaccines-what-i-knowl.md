The mRNA vaccines work by delivering mRNA molecules, along with some fats, into your cells. Recalling from high school biology, mRNA is short for messenger RNA, and its normal purpose is to transfer instructions for making proteins from the permanent DNA in the nucleus to a cell's ribosomes, where the mRNA is translated into the correct sequence of molecules to build a specific protein. In the vaccine's case, the mRNA codes for the coronavirus "spike" protein, which is the spiky bit in the virus cartoons that you see, and helps it enter our cells.

Now playing around with genetic material may sound a little dicey. I have seen a talking point out there that these are not actually vaccines at all, but more like gene therapies. But I do not think this is accurate. First, the mRNA in these vaccines is not DNA, does not even enter the nucleus, and so cannot get incorporated into a cell's genome. It enters the cell, floats around until it gets taken up by a ribosome, and then gets translated into spike protein.

Second, inserting RNA into our cells *is also exactly what the coronavirus does*. This is how viruses replicate - they insert their genetic material into our cells, where it gets translated into viral proteins. In the case of the virus, however, they produce a much larger variety of proteins, because the goal is to assemble the whole virus rather than just a piece. Then those proteins get assembled into viruses, which accumulate until the cell bursts and releases them all, whence they proceed to infect other cells. 

In fact, the coronavirus is a positive-sense RNA virus, which means that its genetic material is RNA that gets directly taken up by our ribosomes - just like the mRNA in the vaccines. (There are other viruses that contain DNA or negative-sense RNA that require intermediate steps.) 

So sure, all things equal, I would rather not have foreign RNA inserted into my cells. But I would rather have it be an RNA for exactly one protein, precisely selected to prime my immune system to avoid a disease, rather than the entire genome of a hostile infectious uncontrollably replicating invader.

Third, inserting RNA or DNA into our cells *is also exactly what many standard vaccines do*. Many standard vaccines, such as measles, rubella, some varieties of polio, smallpox back in the day, are "attenuated virus" vaccines. This means they contain active virus that has been weakened or altered - bred in a certain sense, by letting it evolve in human cell lines in a lab - to not cause disease. It does still infect you, though, by entering your cells and replicating. Because they mimic a real infection, these vaccines often provoke a stronger, more lasting immune response and are therefore more effective.


To my non-expert eyes, the mRNA technology seems like it should be even safer than a standard vaccine. Attenuated vaccines are still active viruses; they have the remote risk of regaining virulence and causing disease after all. That is not a possibilty with the mRNA vaccine. And both types insert genetic material into your cells; but the mRNA vaccine is much more 

The contrast between these types of vaccine also helps explain why development was so quick for the Covid vaccine. Part of the reason that vaccines usually take so long to develop is that the "breeding" of these attenuated viruses can take a long time, and is difficult to steer in the desired direction. For the mRNA vaccine, in contrast, the difficult part was knowing which protein to target - but we knew to target the spike from previous work on the original SARS. After that, it was only a matter of sequencing the virus gene for the spike, manufacturing the mRNA, and doing the testing. (And the testing was made quicker with lots of money, lots of volunteers, and lots of Covid circulating.)


Now these childhood vaccines undoubtedly do have the advantage of long experience and long data collection. I 




Some vaccines, such as "inactivated virus" vaccines, are dead viruses or pieces of viruses to present to the immune system. Examples of these include ...  The Novavax vaccine, which consists of already-assembled spike protein, uses this principle.
