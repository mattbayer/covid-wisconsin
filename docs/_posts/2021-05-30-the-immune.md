Wisconsin is about half vaccinated, and new infections have been declining for several weeks now. Are we done? 50% vaccinated would seem to be too low for the fabled "herd immunity", which is a hazy concept in the first place but 

I find the 50% number encouraging on the one hand, because it will certainly be enough to prevent large surges like last winter, and because the number for the elderly is about 80%, which will prevent most Covid deaths in the future. But I'm discouraged on the other hand, because I would love to just grind coronavirus into the dirt so it can never rise up again, and I don't think 50% is going to get us there.

On the other, other hand, there is a large percentage of people who gained immunity to Covid the old-fashioned way, and it's only fair to include them in the numbers. So in this post I will try to estimate the total number of people with some kind of immunity, whether from vaccination or infection.

My understanding is that it is not certain whether vaccinated or infected immunity is better than the other; the vaccinated seem to have more antibodies, but previously infected people may have better response in other pieces of the immune system. There are indications that natural immunity plus one vaccine dose may be the ideal combination.

But here I'll just treat them as equivalent. I think it's fair to say that whatever hairs you might split between them, both types of immunity confer good protection against reinfection, at least in the short and medium term.

### How many were infected?
First we need to know how many people were infected and therefore have natural immunity. [I addressed this once during the fall surge](2020-10-19-true-infections.md) and [here](https://covid-wisconsin.com/2020/11/22/status-update/#how-many-of-us-have-been-infected)

The CDC now has a [national seroprevalence survey](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#national-lab) - meaning
