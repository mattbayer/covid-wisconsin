title: Variant rates in Midwest states
hidden: true
---

Wisconsin is in the beginnings of a surge in Covid cases, although it is not too bad yet. Many of the states in Wisconsin's neighborhood have it worse - Michigan is having the worst outbreak in the country, and Minnesota and Illinois are in the middle.

At the risk of oversimplifying, I think the trends in these states can basically be attributed to the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant.

### Variant

It is difficult to get good data on the prevalence of these variants. The Wisconsin DHS has [a page on variants](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/variants.htm), but its data is not terribly useful because it only shows overall totals, with no indication of how prevalence is changing over time. We don't really care how common B.1.1.7 was three months ago (not very), we care about how common it is now.

The testing company Helix has been doing public analyses of its data, which so far looks like the best data on the variants in the United States. But the company doesn't do enough testing in Wisconsin to make estimates for out state - though it does have numbers for Michigan and Minnesota.

The international database GISAID has records of many genetic sequences.

Finally, [the CDC has an estimate](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-proportions.html#variant-proportions) of the prevalence of different variants in each state, measured over a four-week period ending March 13.


State | Proportion of B.1.1.7 
------| ---------- 
Illinois  | 13.1%
Michigan  | 39.0%
Minnesota | 25.5%
Wisconsin | 9.5%
