title: Variant rates in Midwest states
hidden: true
---

Wisconsin is in the beginnings of a surge in Covid cases. Many of the states in Wisconsin's neighborhood have it worse, especially Michigan but also Minnesota and Illinois. I think the trends in these states can mostly be attributed to the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant.

### 
Below is a plot of average cases per day for these four states, using [data from the New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

For the current wave, it is easy to rank these states in order of severity. Michigan is the worst, followed by Minnesota, Illinois, and last Wisconsin. It is still possible Wisconsin will follow the same trajectory as Michigan, but with ongoing vaccination and possibly more favorable seasonality coming on, I would expect our later start to the wave to lead to a better outcome overall.

But why the different trajectories in the different states? My guess is that the driving force is the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant.

Here is [the CDC's estimate](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fvariant-proportions.html#variant-proportions) for the prevalence of B.1.1.7 in each state, measured over a four-week period ending March 13. 

State | Proportion of B.1.1.7 
------| ---------- 
Illinois  | 13.1%
Michigan  | 39.0%
Minnesota | 25.5%
Wisconsin | 9.5%

The higher a state's B.1.1.7 prevalence a month ago, the earlier and higher their cases have now spiked. This suggests that the spread of this more transmissible variant may be sufficient on its own to explain these state differences.

A contrary data point is that other states outside the Midwest, Florida in particular, also have high B.1.1.7 prevalence but are not surging like Michigan. For these states, though, I would speculate that the more favorable climate at this time of year is offsetting some of the B.1.1.7 effect.

Returning to the Midwest, another possibility suggested by the plot above is that the states with relatively lighter fall waves are the ones that are now surging higher; Michigan's fall appears to have been the easiest and Wisconsin's the hardest. Perhaps as a result Wisconsin had more built-up natural immunity, or more entrenched cautionary behavior coming out of the fall wave, and therefore was more resistant in the spring.



### Variant

It is difficult to get good data on the prevalence of these variants. The Wisconsin DHS has [a page on variants](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/variants.htm), but its data is not terribly useful because it only shows overall totals, with no indication of how prevalence is changing over time. We don't really care how common B.1.1.7 was three months ago (not very), we care about how common it is now.

The testing company Helix has been doing public analyses of its data, which so far looks like the best data on the variants in the United States. But the company doesn't do enough testing in Wisconsin to make estimates for out state - though it does have numbers for Michigan and Minnesota.

The international database GISAID has records of many genetic sequences.
