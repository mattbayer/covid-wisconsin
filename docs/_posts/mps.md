I am listening to the MPS board meeting tonight, where they will (eventually - it's been going since 5:30) vote on the district's reopening plan.

My opinion is at this stage in the pandemic, they should reopen schools for in-person learning, with appropriate precautions.

Many public commenters are criticizing the thoroughness or various details of the district's plan, and the administration's lack of negotiation with the union. I have no expertise on these particulars.

But I can comment on a number of other arguments made that I believe are either not accurate, or are outweighed by the benefit of in-person learning.

"The pandemic is not over." No, but in Milwaukee all the indicators - case numbers, test positivity rate, hospitalizations - are as low as they have *ever* been. 

Most other schools in the state, including charters and private schools in the city, have had some level of in-person instruction before now, some even extending through the fall surge. This has not led to massive school outbreaks. If other schools can manage it through the surge, I would think MPS can manage it now.

"We should wait until kids can be vaccinated." Vaccines are not currently approved for anyone under 16. The required studies have only recently begun, and it is far from guaranteed that they will be approved by the fall. Are we prepared to begin *another* year with virtual school?

"Kids can transmit Covid." This is true, though probably less easily than adults. It is equally true that kids are not at high risk of bad outcomes if they catch Covid.

"Teachers will be required to come in to buildings before being fully vaccinated." The current proposal is for teachers to return to buildings in late March, to prepare for students on April 12. Late March would indeed be before the full course of vaccinations. But the clinical trial data indicate that all the vaccines are very effective only two weeks after the first dose. The second dose improves this further, but the majority of protection is already there. 

The state and city explicitly prioritized teachers for vaccinations on the presumption that they would be in classrooms, exposed to higher risk. 

To be blunt: If MPS teachers were not going to go back into classrooms, we should have given those doses to others.
